### Learning Goals:
- Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:
 - DRY JavaScript
 - Event delegation to handle similar event listeners
- Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
- Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops
- Use your problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge

### Wins + Challenges:

- Wins
  - I was able to finish the required portions of the project with a few days to spare.
  - I was able to impelment the timeout functionality, which I had never used before, with relative ease.
  - I was able to add a unique styling with a background image from Unsplash into my project.
  - I was able to mostly demonstrate mastery of the Single Responsibility Principle and keep my code DRY in my JavaScript.
  - I understand how to separate my DOM from my Data Model.
- Challenges
  - Implementing the check for win functionality was very challenging and I had to ask for help from my rock.
  - Knowing which order functions should be fired in the event listener was also a challenge
  - Making a cohesive color palette was also challenging. Knowing which colors work well with others is a portion that I need to work at.
  - Ensuring that the project is responsive and fits all screens properly is another element, while not a requirement at this stage, that I would like to focus on in the future.
